# The-iris-sample-dataset-into-Python-using-a-Pandas-
Loaded the iris sample dataset into Python using a Pandas dataframe. Performed
a PCA using the Scikit Decomposition component, and provided the percentage
of variance explained by the 1st Principal Component. 
Used Matplotlib to plot the 1st/2nd Principal Components to recreate the scatterplot shown in class,
with colored classes for each flower type.
